# javascript-challenge

## Objective
The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate competency in JavaScript and basic DOM manipulation with the [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) as well as apply previously-acquired skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Background
A dataset consisting of an array of UFO sighting events was provided. Each observation in the array is a JavaScript object containing a number of key:value pairs describing following:

* Date of the sighting
* Location of sighting (one key:value for country, state/provide, and city)
* Shape of the UFO
* Brief and oftentimes incomplete notes of the sighting

The goal of the assignment is to create a webpage to display the UFO sighting data in an HTML table and provide means for users to filter the displayed table using on various inputs.
